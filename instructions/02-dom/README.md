# DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) lets our code read from and write to the content of a web-page. It is a programming interface for HTML. We can use it to make our web pages interactive.

> 
> 🔍 Search and select HTML elements   
> ✍️ Manipulate the DOM
> - ⚡ Change properties on HTML elements  
> - ☎️ Call methods on HTML elements  
> - 🆕 Create new HTML elements in the DOM  
>

> 🎬 React to events on HTML elements
